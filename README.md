# OMWH — On My Way Home

OMWH adds two simple teleport commands to Fabric: `/home` for returning to your bed or respawn anchor, and `/spawn` for getting back to the spawn point in the dimension you are already in.

It is built for servers that want convenient travel without turning `/home` and `/spawn` into free cross-dimension warps. Players can get unstuck, regroup, or head back to a safe point, while server owners keep control over cooldowns, messages, command names, and teleport effects.

Built by [PyreHaven](https://pyrehaven.xyz) and used on the [PyreHaven Minecraft Server](https://pyrehaven.xyz).

## What the commands do

### `/home`

Teleports a player to their current respawn point. That means their bed in the Overworld or their respawn anchor in the Nether, as long as the point is valid.

OMWH uses Minecraft's normal placement around the respawn point instead of moving the player upward until it finds room. `/home` stays in the player's current dimension and will not move someone from the Nether back to an Overworld bed.

### `/spawn`

Teleports a player to a nearby safe position at the spawn point for the dimension they are already in:

- Overworld: the world spawn
- Nether: the Nether spawn point
- End: the obsidian platform

OMWH requires solid support and enough clear space for the player or vehicle. Like `/home`, `/spawn` does not cross dimensions.

### Mounts and passengers

If a player is riding something when they teleport, OMWH brings the ride with them. Horses, boats, pigs, striders, and similar mounts stay attached. Passengers inside the same vehicle, including other players, come along too.

OMWH checks that the destination can fit the vehicle before moving it. `/spawn` looks for nearby safe ground with enough room for the whole vehicle. At `/home`, Minecraft's normal bed position is used when it fits; a mounted player may instead be placed directly above an uncovered bed when the vehicle cannot fit beside it.

## Why server owners use it

- Keeps `/home` and `/spawn` useful without making them global warp commands
- Works server-side only, so players do not need to install anything on their client
- Lets admins tune cooldowns for normal use, combat, recent damage, and joining the server
- Supports custom command names, such as `/h` and `/s`
- Lets you rewrite messages and use the `{time}` placeholder for cooldown warnings
- Can play a sound and show particles when a teleport finishes
- Uses safe spawn placement with solid support and enough room for the player or vehicle

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for Minecraft 26.2.
2. Install [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
3. Drop the OMWH jar into your `mods/` folder.
4. Start the game or server once. OMWH creates `config/omwh.json` automatically.

OMWH works in singleplayer and on dedicated servers. On servers, install it on the server only; clients do not need the mod.
